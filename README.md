**Basic Machine Learning Model in C**

Single neuron
- Resembled a perceptron using finite difference and gradient descant
- Trained to function as OR, AND, NAND, or NOR logic gate

Multi layer neuron
- Created a multi layer neurons (two layers) to resemble XOR logic gate
- comparison with seperately trained neurons
